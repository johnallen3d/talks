[Docker Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

Loosely analogy would be a saved virtual machine: A package meant to issolate a running application/process
* Docker is an open-source project based on Linux containers.
* It uses Linux Kernel features like namespaces and control groups to create containers on top of an operating system.
* Containers are far from new; Google has been using their own container technology for years.
* Others Linux container technologies include Solaris Zones, BSD jails, and LXC, which have been around for many years.

TKXS Use Cases

* development - Docker for Mac
* CI/CD with CircleCI/Codeship
* production apps (on Heroku or ECS)

---

# Terminology: image

An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

### Examples

* [IIS](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore-iis)
* [NGINX](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
* [Ruby](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby)
* [Interlok](https://hub.docker.com/r/adaptris/interlok)
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server)

???

```
docker run --rm hello-world
```

* image layers
* registries

---

# Terminology: container

A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process).

![container-visual](./assets/container_visual.png "Container Visual")

???

[A Beginner-Friendly Introduction to Containers, VMs and Docker](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b)

Loosely analogy would be the instance a virtual machine configured to run IIS:

* Major difference is that containers share the kernel with their host and don't require a complete operating system

---

# Terminology: Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a set of instructions that can be used to construct an image.

```Dockerfile
# the image to use as a starting point
FROM ruby:2.6-alpine

# the context (location) for subsequent commands and the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# add files from the working directory on the host to the "WORKDIR"
COPY . .

# an instruction to run when a container instance started
CMD ["ruby", "-run", "-e", "httpd", "--", "-p", "5000", "."]
```

???

* talk about layers and caching

---

# Live Demo: build and run

Combine what we've learned so far to run a container

```sh
# build an image from the Dockerfile
docker build -t ruby-example .
```

```sh
# run an instance of the image which starts a container
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 ruby-example
```

```sh
# hit the page in a browser
open http://localhost:5000
```

???

#### build params

* `-t` provides a tag or name for the image that is being built
* trailing dot is the path to the context for the build

#### run params

* `--rm` tells Docker to remove the image after it exists
* `-p` map port `5000` on the host to port `5000` inside the container
* final arg - name of the image to run. could be an id

#### other

* run `docker images`
* run `docker ps`
* changes are not reflected until rebuild/restart

---

# Tooling: Docker Compose

A tool that can process a set of instructions (in YAML format) and execute a series of Docker API commands

```yaml
version: "2.3"

services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    links:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: moby
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: seaworld
```

???

* `web:/postgres:` are user defined names for services
* `context:` matches argument to `docker run`
* `ports:` matches `-p` argument to `docker run`
* `volumes:` allows us to "bind mount" data into running container
* `links:` tells compose to auto-start linked container and enable networking
* `image:` tells compose to start a container from a tagged image vs. building local Dockerfile
* `environment:` defines environment variables that are injected into the newly created container

---

# Live Demo: build and run - compose

```sh
# build all of the services defined in the config
docker-compose build
```

```sh
# start up and link together all of the services
docker-compose up
```

```sh
# alternatively start a sinble services
docker-compose up db
```

???

* point out the name of the build image for web `ruby_web`
* looks at logs
* mention `-d --detach` flag for `up`

#### database is running, initialize and networked to web
```
docker-compose run --rm web ash
ping db

docker exec -it ruby_db_1 bash
env | grep POSTGRES
psql -U moby -W ocean
\l
```

# Real World Example: Camunda

[Camunda](https://camunda.com) is an open source platform for workflow and decision automation.

#### Docker Hub

> Docker Hub is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your teams' container applications.

[https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)

```sh
docker run \
  -d \
  --name camunda \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest

# open http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html
```

???

docker ps
docker stop camunda
docker rm camunda

# Docker for Windows: ðŸ¤ž

That's all well and good but what about Windows?!

![windows_firewall](./assets/docker_for_windows_firewall.png "Docker for Windows - Firewall")

```sh
C:\> choco install docker-for-windows
C:\> docker run mcr.microsoft.com/mcr/hello-world
```

???

```
docker build -t hello-windows .
docker run --rm hello-windows
```

```
start a powershell as admin
Start-Process powershell -verb runAs
```

---

# Live Demo: build and run - compose

```sh
# build all of the services defined in the config
docker-compose build
```

```sh
# start up and link together all of the services
docker-compose up
```

# nib

```
choco install ruby
gem install nib
gem install nib-integrate
